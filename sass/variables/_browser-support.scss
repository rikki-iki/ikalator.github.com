// Browser support
//
// Based on caniuse.com's browser usage stats, Compass will support any browser
// that is used by at least 1 user in 10,000. These variables are used to
// specify which browsers are supported by Compass. "Unsupported" browsers will
// still see the generated CSS, of course, but will not get special treatment
// for its bugs or CSS3 vendor prefixes.
//

// The browser usage threshold for features that cannot degrade gracefully.
// A value of 100 means 100% of users would have to use the browser before it is
// supported. A value of 0.01 (the default) means 1 user in 10,000.
$critical-usage-threshold: 0.3;

// Set this to true to generate comments that will explain why a prefix was
// included or omitted.
$debug-browser-support: false;

// Optional map of minimum browser versions to support. If a specific browser
// has usage stats below the $critical-usage-threshold, you can still require
// support for it using this variable. For example, to require support for IE 6
// and later, set $browser-minimum-versions['ie'] to '6'.
$browser-minimum-versions: (
    'chrome':  null,
    'firefox': null,
    'ie':      '9',
    'safari':  null,
    'opera':   null
);

//
// Border-box support for IE 6/7
//
// IE6-7 don't support box-sizing: border-box. We can fix this in 1 of 3 ways:
// - Drop support for IE 6/7. :-) Set $critical-usage-threshold to a value high
//   enough to drop IE7 users.
// - Install the box-sizing polyfill and set the variable below to
//   the absolute path URL to the boxsizing.htc file.
//   @see https://github.com/Schepp/box-sizing-polyfill
//   $box-sizing-polyfill-path: '/path/to/boxsizing.htc';
// - Use the same CSS unit for grid and gutter width in resonsive-sidebars.scss
//   (use px for both or use % for both) and set:
//   $box-sizing: content-box;
//
