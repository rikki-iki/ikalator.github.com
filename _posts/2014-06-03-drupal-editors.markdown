##  Field Group

This is an absolute must in my mind. Wrap all your node fields in a vertical tab (or two). Then within that vertical tab, add fieldset groups to contain other optional or related fields.

## Admin Menu & Admin Menu Source

I've always used admin menu, but only recently found admin menu source. Make a custom admin menu based on a users role! Only show them what they need and group the links in a way that will make sense to them.

## Admin views & VBO

Customise and fine-tune Drupals default Content, User, Comment and File admin views. Add relavant filters and bulk operations to make content easy to find and update.

## Better formats & WYSIWYG

Control what text formats are available to each formattable field. I always have a very simple rich-text text format, but some fields need more options, in which case I can set them to use the WYSIWYG editor. I also prefer CKEditor for my WYSIWYG as it has better accessibility. But whatever WYSIWYG you use, limit the buttons to the absolute bare essential.

## Images, Documents and Video

Now I know a lot of people like the Media module, but in Drupal 7 there's an alternative set of modules that I find much more flexible. They are: IMCE, WYSIWYG, Filefield Sources, Insert and Float Filter and you can [read all about it here](http://purewebmedia.biz/article/2013/01/10/inserting-and-floating-inline-images-drupal-7). I also add the [Video Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/video_filter) module in for easily embedding YouTube and Vimeo clips.

## Draggable views

Create an admin display of any view that allows the editor drag content around until it's in the order they like! This is great for blocks of small content like featured content or slideshows.

Nodequeue is an alternative to Draggable views, which has something called a Smartqueue API - I haven't tested it out yet, but it sounds quite powerfull.

## Dashboard

Dashboard is a core module with Drupal 7 and one I've overlooked for a while now. In combination with Admin Views you can create wuite a useful content dashboard tailored to the editors common tasks.

One other thing we've been working on recently is providing user documentation, tailored to each customised Drupal install, that is accessibly right inside Drupal. With an index of tasks/topics shown on the dashboard and a 'Help' link readily available in the Admin Menu.

## Custom contextual links

A part of this I haven't started digging into yet is Custom Contextual Links. Which lets you add your own links to the little edit cog that shows up when you hover certain things like nodes, blocks and views (if you haven't played with them even I recommend it - the Contextual Links module is in Drupal 7 core).
